	This is an incomplete prototype driver developed for the HP
	Color LaserJet 1500 laser printer.  The author has "paused"
	development, and will continue when someone expresses
	meaningful interest in the form of sponsorship.

        &lt;p&gt;
	
	It is possible that this driver will also work for other Oak
	Technologies OAKT-based printers, but the author cannot test this.

        &lt;p&gt;
	
	The driver supports 1-bit or 2-bit per pixel monochrome and
	color output, but none of these have been tuned for grayscale
	or color correction.
