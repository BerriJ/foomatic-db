  <en>This driver is a GPL DeskJet 2200 driver provided by HP (!).  It's based on 
Uli and Matthew's  &lt;a href="show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj850"&gt;cdj850&lt;/a&gt;  
and  &lt;a href="show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj880"&gt;cdj880&lt;/a&gt;  drivers, with 
a new front-end to speak the different RGB-encoded PCL flavor used by these
printers.
&lt;p&gt;
The provided source is for gs 6.01; it probably works against anything at all
recent. It's unclear which gs or GNU/Linux distributions provide this driver, 
if any.
&lt;p&gt;
After getting a tip from the driver's author I succeeded to compile it for
GNU GhostScript 5.50. You must copy the function "gdev_pcl_mode9compress" from the
gdevcd8.c file of the  &lt;a href="show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj880"&gt;cdj880&lt;/a&gt; 
driver into the end of the gdevcd8.c of HP's "chp2200" driver. Then you follow
the instructions in HP's source package and GhostScript will compile.&lt;p&gt;

    <en>This driver does only 600x600, not 1200x600 in presentation quality.</en>

    <en>This driver published by HP under the GPL (!) sends RGB data to the
printer. This makes the printer transferring the data to CMYK by
itself and so it gives a colour quality as good as under Windows.</en>
