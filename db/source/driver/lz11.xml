  Provides 600dpi color and grayscale printing on the Lexmark Z11,
  using GhostScript's internal dithering. Version of the "cZ11" driver
  from Christian Kornblum, with enhancements and bug fixes from
  Som-Som, Erik Bernhardson, Mihael Hategan, and Till
  Kamppeter.&lt;p&gt;

  A bug preventing from printing multiple-page documents is fixed,
  printing documents with page sizes other than letter works properly
  now, and the package comes with install and uninstall scripts.&lt;p&gt;

  The package comes with two GhostScript wrappers, one which has
  exactly the same command line as GhostScript and maps requests with
  a certain user-chosen GhostScript device (as "hpdj", "epsonc", ...)
  to the use of GhostScript with the "cZ11" filter. So old printing
  systems which do not support filters being used after GhostScript
  (as RHS Printfilters) can be used. The second wrapper is for use
  with this Foomatic data.&lt;p&gt;

  The resolution of the printer is not exactly 600 dpi, so adjust it to
  obtain the correct printout size.&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: There is no release of the package on its
  home page yet. Download the package from &lt;a
  href=&quot;http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/printing/lz11.tar.gz&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
  for now.&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;: This driver is known not to work with
  the Z31 and Z51.  In fact, it is known to hose those printers' flash
  in some circumstances, making your nearly useless Lexmark inkjet
  100% useless!&lt;p&gt;
