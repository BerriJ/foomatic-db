    All the Epson laser printers understand PCL 5e, PCL 6, and/or
    PostScript and so they should work with standard drivers, but this
    driver provided by Epson gives some additional options to the
    supported printers.&lt;p&gt;

    Version 1.0.4 of this driver works only with GhostScript 5.50, not
    with GhostScript 6.5x and newer.  For the new GhostScript versions
    use &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-6.51-Epson_eplaseren.patch&quot;&gt;this
    patch&lt;/a&gt; from Crutcher Dunnavant (Red Hat).&lt;p&gt;

    The driver&apos;s web page offers the new version 3.0.2 only for
    the AcuLaser C4000, but in reality it supports all printers which
    the previous version already supported plus the AcuLaser C4000. So
    choose always the AcuLaser C4000 as your printer model when
    downloading the driver, regardless what model you really
    have. During the installation take care again which model you
    have. This driver version is prepared for both GhostScript 5.x and
    6.x. For GhostScript 7.x or newer a small fix is needed: Execute
    the following command line in the main directory of the unpacked
    driver source package:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;tt&gt;perl -p -i -e
    &quot;s/GS_VERSION_MAJOR\s*==\s*6/GS_VERSION_MAJOR &amp;gt;=
    6/&quot; gdevescv.c gdevesmv.c&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    Then the driver also compiles with these versions of
    GhostScript.&lt;p&gt;
