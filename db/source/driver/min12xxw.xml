       Min12xxw is a pbm filter by Manuel Tobias Schiller for various
       Minolta PagePro -W series printers.

       &lt;p&gt;

       Min12xxw should run on most *nix-like workstations without major problems. The only
       problem that is to be expected on non-Linux systems are missing  library  functions
       such as getline or getopt_long. The query options may or may not work on other sys-
       tems, depending on the characteristics of the printer driver and the interface used
       (USB, very old style parallel port or a more recent one...).

       &lt;p&gt;

       Min12xxw  was written without any documentation from the manufacturer. The descrip-
       tion of the printer language may  be  inaccurate  or  even  wrong  because  it  was
       obtained by looking at the output of the windoof driver only. The code dealing with
       the compression of raster data is in its spirit heavily based on an initial  driver
       by  Adam  Bocim, who  managed  to find out how things are done
       (thanks, Adam, you did a great job!).  This new  version  is  considerably  faster,
       implemented more cleanly and (hopefully) well documented.

       &lt;p&gt;

       It also features querying the printer status and page counter,
       a suggestion made by Bruno Schoedlbauer, who also pointed me to
       a nice USB sniffer by Benoit Papillault for Windoof 98 and up,
       see &lt;a href="http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop"
       &gt;http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop&lt;/a&gt;.  (This
       little program may prove very helpful on similar occasions.
       Happy USB sniffing...)

       &lt;p&gt;

       Even  though  this program has been designed with care and much thought, no-one can
       guarantee that this program will not damage your printer,  computer  or  even  your
       neighbour's car, because it was built without knowing exactly how things work, it's
       only a (hopefully) reasonable guess. (However, my printer  does  still  work,  even
       after  the testing phase when a lot of wrong stuff was sent to it. And my neighbour
       hasn't complained either...)

       &lt;p&gt;

       Most of the available paper sizes have  not  actually  been  verified  to  work  as
       adverised  -  reports  about  successes or problems are welcome.  Also the code for
       querying the printer is not heavily tested. If you have comments to  make  or  know
       more about the format than I do, please share your thoughts and your knowledge.
