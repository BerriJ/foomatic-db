    This driver is a little bit special, the printer is connected by
    the serial port and the driver asks the printer which model it
    is. So the connection between driver and printer must be
    bidirectional. With LPD this is no problem, it issues the command
    line shown here under &quot;Execution Details&quot; plus a "
    &amp;gt; DEVICE" where DEVICE is the /dev file for the serial port
    where the printer is connected to. CUPS passes the output of the
    driver command line shown here through a backend filter which does
    not support bidirectional access. Use the "Device" option to send
    the output directly to the /dev file. Give read/write access to
    the user "lp" to make this possible. If the desired device is not
    under the choices, use the "Link stylewriter in dev ..."  option
    and set a link of your device file to /dev/stylewriter.&lt;p&gt;
    
    The original home page of the driver does not exist any more, To
    make the driver available I (Till) have put version 0.9.9 (which I
    have downloaded for including in Mandrake Linux a year ago) into
    the download area of linuxprinting.org.
