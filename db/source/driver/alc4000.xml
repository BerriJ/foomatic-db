    The Epson color laser printers understand PCL 5e or PCL 6 but
    print only in grayscale with these languages. PostScript is an
    option which costs around 250 US$. This driver provided by Epson
    allows colour printing on the non-PostScript models and gives some
    additional options to the supported printers.&lt;p&gt;

    There is a version 1.0.4 of Epson&apos;s laser printer
    drivers. This version has no &quot;alc4000&quot; device. You have
    to use at least version 3.0.2, which you automatically get when
    you choose the AcuLaser C4000 as your printer model on
    Epson&apos;s driver download page. This driver version is prepared
    for both GhostScript 5.x and 6.x. For GhostScript 7.x or newer a
    small fix is needed: Execute the following command line in the
    main directory of the unpacked driver source package:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;tt&gt;perl -p -i -e
    &quot;s/GS_VERSION_MAJOR\s*==\s*6/GS_VERSION_MAJOR &amp;gt;=
    6/&quot; gdevescv.c gdevesmv.c&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    Then the driver also compiles with these versions of
    GhostScript.&lt;p&gt;

    On the home page of this driver is told that it only supports
    grayscale but I have tested it and it prints in
    colour. Unfortunately, the driver needs a lot of resources and so
    for high-resolution photos 512 MB RAM and a fast processor are
    recommended (or alternatively the PostScript module).&lt;p&gt;
