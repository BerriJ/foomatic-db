    Cheap, compact desktop laser printer, foldable tray for 150
    sheets, A4/Letter/Legal, up to 14 pages/min. Somewhat faster than
    the LaserJet 1010, "Fastres 1200" resolution enhancement.&lt;p&gt;

    HP classifies this printer as "host-based" whereas they claim the
    HP LaserJet 1015 to understand PCL 5e. But the HP LaserJet 1010
    and 1012 seem to understand a stripped-down (raster-graphics only,
    no text) variant of PCL 5e.&lt;p&gt;

    Rick Richardson (rickr at mn dot rr dot com), author of the
    &quot;foo2zjs&quot; driver (driver for the HP LaserJet 1000/1005),
    has examined the output of the Windows driver for this printer and
    found out that the language looks like PJL + PCL 6 (see report
    on the HP forum on linuxprinting.org).&lt;p&gt;

    Adam (madaman at web dot de) reports on the HP forum on
    linuxprinting.org that the HP LaserJet 1010 works for him with all
    raster drivers for the HP LaserJet 1100 ("hpijs",
    "ljet4"/"lj4dith", "gimp-print"/"gimp-print-ijs"). Adam tried also
    PCL-6 drivers ("lj5gray"/"lj5mono", "pxlmono") but without
    success.&lt;p&gt;
    
    Unfortunately, the new LaserJet 1010/1012/1015 series seems not to
    be absolutely compatible with older HP printers or it has a
    firmware bug. Sometimes it happens that the printer stops working
    and reports the error "&lt;tt&gt;Unsupported Personality:
    PCL&lt;/tt&gt;". It only continues working when one kills the job
    and power-cycles the printer. So up to now it is not recommended
    to buy this printer.&lt;p&gt;

    Please test the printer with these drivers in all available
    resolutions and also with special options as toner saving. REt,
    toner density, ... Try also the PPD files for the HP LaserJet 4050
    to test the "FastRes" option with a resolution setting of 600
    dpi. Does this give a better printout quality? Please report all
    your results and experiences on the HP forum of
    linuxprinting.org.&lt;p&gt;
