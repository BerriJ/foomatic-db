    Cheap, compact desktop laser printer, foldable tray for 150
    sheets, A4/Letter/Legal, up to 14 pages/min. Somewhat faster than
    the LaserJet 1010, "Fastres 1200" resolution enhancement.&lt;p&gt;

    HP classifies this printer as "host-based" whereas they claim the
    HP LaserJet 1015 to understand PCL 5e. But the HP LaserJet 1010
    and 1012 seem to understand a stripped-down (raster-graohic only,
    no text) variant of PCL 5e and perhaps also 6.&lt;p&gt;

    Rick Richardson (rickr at mn dot rr dot com), author of the
    &quot;foo2zjs&quot; driver (driver for the HP LaserJet 1000/1005),
    has examined the output of the Windows driver for this printer and
    found out that the language looks like PJL + PCL 6/XL (see report
    on the HP forum on linuxprinting.org).&lt;p&gt;

    Adam (madaman at web dot de) reports on the HP forum on
    linuxprinting.org that the HP LaserJet 1010 works for him with
    drivers for the HP LaserJet 1100, especially the "lj4dith"
    driver.&lt;p&gt;

    This shows that the HP LaserJet 101x series works at least with
    PCL 5e raster drivers ("hpijs", "ljet4"/"lj4dith",
    "gimp-print"/"gimp-print-ijs"). It perhaps also works with raster
    drivers for PCL 6/XL ("lj5gray"/"lj5mono", but most probably not
    "pxlmono", as "pxlmono" is a vector driver which printe text as
    text).&lt;p&gt;
    
    So please test the printer with these drivers in all available
    resolutions and also with other option settings. Try also downloading
    the PPD files for the HP LaserJetb 4050 with these drivers, to test
    extra options as toner saving, and especially "FastRes" with both
    600 dpi and 1200 dpi as resolution setting. Please report all your
    results and experiences on the HP forum of linuxprinting.org.&lt;p&gt;
