    Cheap, compact desktop laser printer, foldable tray for 150
    sheets, A4/Letter/Legal, up to 14 pages/min. Somewhat faster than
    the LaserJet 1010, "Fastres 1200" resolution enhancement.&lt;p&gt;

    Seems not to understand any standard language. There is no report
    about this printer working on a GNU/Linux or Unix system and HP
    classifies it as "host-based".&lt;p&gt;

    Rick Richardson (rickr at mn dot rr dot com), author of the
    &quot;foo2zjs&quot; driver (driver for the HP LaserJet 1000/1005),
    has examined the output of the Windows driver for this printer and
    found out that the language looks like PCL + PCL 6/XL (see report
    on the HP forum on linuxprinting.org). Probably the printer
    understands a stripped-down PCL 6 without text capabilities. So it
    would be interesting to try this printer with the
    "lj5gray"/"lj5mono" drivers (NOT the "pxlmono" driver, because
    "pxlmono" is a vector driver which sends text as text).&lt;p&gt;
