    <en>Eddie Torres (veloct@veloct.net) reported:&lt;br&gt;
Does not work with all drivers from LaserJet 2 to 4
except &quot;laserjet&quot;. &quot;ljet2p&quot; works partially: it has
stair-stepping and strange symbols at the
left-hand-side of the page. &quot;hl1250&quot; does
not work at all&lt;p&gt;

Roger (roger@linuxfreemail.com) reports that the &quot;hl1250&quot; driver works, but with
incorrect margins.&lt;p&gt;

Comments from other users:&lt;br&gt;
Works great using the HP LaserJet 4/5/6 driver and Ghostscript.
&lt;br&gt;600dpi not supported via PCL alone, you must preface jobs with a PJL statement:
&lt;BR&gt;The easiest way to do this is by adding the following line to your printcap file:
&lt;BR&gt;:ld=\033%-12345X@PJL\r\n@PJL SET RESOLUTION=600\r\n:
 
Otherwise, just use the following string:
&amp;lt;ESC&amp;gt;%-12345X@PJL SET RESOLUTION=600
 
as well as selecting 600 dpi from the gs command line.
&lt;br&gt;
This printer has 2MB memory, which cannot be extended;  this may not be enough for all jobs at 600dpi .  Until someone says otherwise, I want this printer to be marked imperfect because of this memory issue.
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
The above steps may not work if you have
RedHat 6.0 or previous versions. I was able
to get the printer working with an HP LaserJet 
driver and 300 dpi. 600dpi did not
work well at all.
&lt;p&gt;
There&apos;s a &lt;a 
href=&quot;http://www.linuxprinting.org/pipermail/brother-list/2000q4/000040.html&quot; 
&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; around the special driver for this printer; apparently it&apos;s
got a bug of some sort.  I guess the other drivers still work, but it&apos;s all a
bit unclear right now.</en>
