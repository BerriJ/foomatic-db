    This printer is not designed for usage with a PC, but for TV
    set-top boxes which provide internet access. Therefore it has a
    case of the shape of a VCR to easily integrate it in the home
    entertainment environment.&lt;p&gt;

    Nevertheless, this printer provides a standard USB and parallel port and
    understands PCL 3, which makes it also working as a normal PC printer,
    at least the developers of HP&apos;s &quot;hpjis&quot; driver claim 
    that. Windows drivers seem not to exist for this model (do we have the 
    first linprinter now?).&lt;p&gt;

    To get its maximum quality, use the &quot;hpijs&quot; driver. 600
    dpi in colour is not supported by the hardware.&lt;p&gt;
