    This printer is not yet supported by Gimp-Print, but support for
    it is under development, but it will most probably take a longer
    time until this device is really supported.&lt;p&gt;

    This printer has is an 8-color (CMYK + red + blue + "gloss
    enhancer", with two different black inks installed) printer with
    1.5 pl drop size. There is nominal support in the Gimp-Print
    driver 5.0.x that may or may not work in CMYK mode, but the
    Gimp-Print developers are not very confident in it. It should be
    an extremely fast printer with a huge gamut (particularly since it
    uses UltraChrome inks, which are pigment but which have a very
    large gamut even in CMYK form).&lt;p&gt;
