    Portable printer, currently the best portable on the market. The
    &quot;ci&quot; model comes without and the &quot;cbi&quot; with
    rechargeable battery.&lt;p&gt;

    Connection via parallel port, USB, and fast infrared. Bluetooth
    optional&lt;p&gt;

    The printer has a reader for Compact Flash memory cards, but no
    facility to choose the images to be printed. One needs a camera
    with DPOF (Digital Print Order Format) for PC-less photo
    printing.&lt;p&gt;

    The best printout quality you will get with the &quot;hpijs&quot;
    driver, provided by &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://hpinkjet.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;
    (compatible to the HP DeskJet 990C), especially the 1200-dpi high
    resolution mode gives excellent photo quality (the rendered bitmap
    is 1200x1200 dpi, but the printer hardware does an interpolation
    then and prints with the printer&apos;s highest resolution). Also
    the Gimp-Print driver is reported to work (Model setting:
    &quot;pcl-900&quot;).&lt;p&gt;

    When used with HP&apos;s &quot;hpijs&quot; driver, this printer
    auto-detects the ink cartridge type and does
    appropriate dithering and colour adjustment internally, controlled
    by the hardware. So when GhostScript with the &quot;hpijs&quot;
    driver only renders the image with 300 or 600 dpi, higher
    resolutions are used for the internal dithering. So if you insert
    a photo cartridge, the printer automatically switches to the 6-ink
    process.&lt;p&gt;

    Note that in contrary to most other current HP inkjet printers
    there is no paper type sensor in the printer. You have to choose
    one of the photo modes manually when using photo paper. There are
    photo modes with 300 and 600 dpi and a special high resolution
    photo mode where the image is rendered in 1200 dpi and
    interpolated to 4800x1200 dpi by the hardware.&lt;p&gt;

    There is also no full-bleed mode as the other printers of the same
    generation (DeskJet 555x, OfficeJet 61xx, PSC 2xxx, PhotoSmart
    7xxx) have, but the unprintable margins are smaller when using the
    photo/card/envelope feeder.&lt;p&gt;

    There is also no automatic head alignment, but it is possible to
    do this manually with free software. Proceed as follows (head
    alignment is not needed when only one cartridge is
    installed):&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

    Copy the needed files from the driver CD which comes with the 
    printer:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;pre&gt;
   cp -a /mnt/cdrom/Drivers/DOS/europe/PCL .
    &lt;/pre&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;

    Print the alignment page in raw (unfiltered) mode of your spooler
    (or send the file directly to the device). If you have the color
    (CMY) cartridge and the black (K) cartridge installed (4-ink mode)
    use&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;pre&gt;
   lpr -l PCL/Align4.pcl
    &lt;/pre&gt;

    and if you have the color (CMY) cartridge and the photo (cmK)
    cartridge installed (6-ink mode) use&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;pre&gt;
   lpr -l PCL/Align6.pcl
    &lt;/pre&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;

    Now look on the printed alignment page and choose the best
    matching pattern in each series, for example A5, B4, C4, and
    D2.&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;

    To align the heads appropriately, "print" the needed alignment
    commands in raw mode (or send them directly to the device). The
    correct commands are in files named
    "&lt;tt&gt;alignXYY.pcl&lt;/tt&gt;". "&lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;" has
    to be replaced by the number of inks and "&lt;tt&gt;YY&lt;/tt&gt;"
    by the ID of the best pattern with the letter in lower case (Note
    that in some file names upper/lower case are not consistent, see
    the directory listing). So for the example above in 4-ink mode you
    have to run the commands:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;pre&gt;
   lpr -l PCL/align4a5.pcl
   lpr -l PCL/align4b4.pcl
   lpr -l PCL/align4c4.pcl
   lpr -l PCL/align4d2.pcl
    &lt;/pre&gt;

    Now the heads are aligned.&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;

    Repeat this procedure whenever you change a cartridge.&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/ol&gt;

    Up/downloading of photos between the PC and the printer/memory
    card works with the &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://hpoj.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;HPOJ&lt;/a&gt;
    low level driver.&lt;p&gt;
