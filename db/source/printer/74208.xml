    Multifunction device: printer/scanner/copier/fax.&lt;p&gt;

    The maximum quality is reached with the &quot;hpijs&quot; driver,
    but due to an incompatibility between the driver and the firmware
    of the device one has to turn off and turn on the device after
    every print job. To avoid this, use another driver. GIMP-Print is
    the best choice but also other PCL drivers as &quot;pcl3&quot; or
    some &quot;cdj...&quot; drivers should work.&lt;p&gt;

    Note that 600 dpi in colour is not supported by the
    hardware.&lt;p&gt;

    Head alignment/cleaning impossible with usual free software and
    also not possible from the front panel.&lt;p&gt;

    Scanning works using the &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://hpoj.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;HPOJ&lt;/a&gt;
    low-level driver together with its &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://panda.mostang.com/sane/&quot;&gt;SANE&lt;/a&gt;
    backend &quot;hpoj&quot;.&lt;p&gt;

    Stand-alone copying works only for black-and-white copies. Color
    copying can only be done by software, under free operating systems
    preferrably with &quot;&lt;tt&gt;xsane&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. Note that
    this is very slow due to the necessity of downloading the whole
    image to the PC and converting it to PostScript and back to a
    bitmap.&lt;p&gt;

    Faxing from and to the PC is not supported.&lt;p&gt;
