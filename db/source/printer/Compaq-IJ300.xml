    <en>This is a rebadged Lexmark printer.  Play with various Lexmark inkjet drivers to figure out which works.
&lt;p&gt;Someone please report what works and which Lexmark this really is!
&lt;p&gt;The Compaq cartridges are the same as the Lexmark ones except for a little plastic tab designed to make them mutually incompatible.  I think you can break off the tab and have it work.  (Not that there&apos;s much point; both lines of cartridges cost a bundle).
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve got one report who said he tried every driver in Mandrake 7.2 and failed.  There are one or two other drivers, but it&apos;s looking poor thus far...
&lt;p&gt;It seems that this printer is more or less compatible with Lexmark Z11.</en>
