    Does not understand any standard language. Works with the
    &quot;foo2zjs&quot; and &quot;pbmtozjs&quot; drivers. The
    &quot;foo2zjs&quot; driver is derived from the
    &quot;pbmtozjs&quot; driver and supports more paper sizes and
    options.&lt;p&gt;

    PCL is only implemented in the Windows driver, to support DOS
    applications in the DOS box of Windows.&lt;p&gt;

    The printer is faster than the LaserJet 1000 and has both USB and
    parallel connection. As the LaserJet 1000, it has only 1 MB of
    RAMand 32 kB of ROM.&lt;p&gt;

    The firmware of the printer must be uploaded after turning it
    on. Note that you cannot simply upload it by commands like
    &quot;&lt;tt&gt;cat sihp1005.img >
    /dev/usb/lp0&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. The &quot;foo2zjs&quot; driver
    package contains a script to do the upload.
