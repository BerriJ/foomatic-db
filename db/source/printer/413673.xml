    <en>C&apos;t magazine reports of the stp driver 4.0beta with this printer:
 
Stp gets rated &apos;sufficient&apos; for photo quality. &quot;The test photo was
printed in decent quality, generally correct colors and a sharpness that
made us happy. The somewhat coarse looking raster and the light stripe
artifacts however drop the rating to &apos;sufficient&apos;&quot;.
&lt;p&gt;
The STP driver printed our test letter too far down on the page. Also
the text page was quite dark and with a green tint, but nicely rastered
and clean text. &quot;If you do not need grey areas, you may want to use this
driver [stp].
 
...this is about what one would expect; the Canon support in stp is only just beginning.</en>
