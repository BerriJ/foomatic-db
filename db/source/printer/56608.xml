This printer has 3 input ports:
 
 Centronics parallel
 serial
 Appletalk.
 
 
&lt;p&gt;
The MC68000 processor is supposed to
recognize which input needs attending.
I have only the parallel port hooked up.
 
&lt;p&gt;
The parallel port seemed to work fine
when the BIOS settings for it were  SPP 
instead of anything fancy, like EPP or ECP.
 
&lt;p&gt;
My setup was Linux 2.2.5 (a la SuSE 6.1).
 
&lt;p&gt;
My  /etc/printcap  lacked a trailing colon
after the  sh  specification which caused
 lpd  not to work until it was fixed.
 
&lt;p&gt;
It has both PostScript and PCL emulation
modes, but I only use the PostScript mode.
