    Sophisticated, but not too expensive 4-ink small-office
    printer. With 20ppm for black text (economy mode) it is very fast
    for an inkjet, faster than many older desktop lasers. Very durable
    water- and light proof printouts and high printing quality on
    normal paper due to pigment inks.&lt;p&gt;

    180 nozzles black, 3x60 nozzles for the colours, 3 pl droplets,
    variable drop size.&lt;p&gt;

    Parallel and USB ports.&lt;p&gt;

    Full support in GIMP-Print 4.1.99b3 or newer.&lt;p&gt;

    Epson only advertises a resolution of 2880x720 for this printer
    (whicch is currently the maximum resolution with the Windows/MacOS
    drivers) with GIMP-Print 4.1.99rc1 and newer it does real
    2880x1440 dpi. For drawings with fine details 1440x1440 dpi is
    recommended because this makes fine vertical and horizontal lines
    having equal widths.&lt;p&gt;

    On the USB this printer needs to be activated with a special
    control sequence, simply sending plain text to it does not make it
    printing. You can send this control sequence by checking the ink
    levels or cleaning the nozzles with
    "&lt;tt&gt;escputil&lt;/tt&gt;", the printer maintenance utility
    which comes with GIMP-Print.&lt;p&gt;
