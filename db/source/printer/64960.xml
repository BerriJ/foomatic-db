    Multifunction device - copier/scanner/fax/etc.&lt;p&gt;

    PCL 4 emulation appears to be host-based.&lt;p&gt;

    Known variants: 3100xi (US retail), 3100se (US business). 3100 is
    international model.&lt;p&gt;

    Not usable with free software: an HP tech support person told that
    half of the 3100&apos;s functionality is handled by the
    Windows-only drivers. Thus, even if you were on a Windows machine
    and go to the DOS prompt, doing &quot;DIR &amp;gt; LPT1:&quot;
    will fail; everything has to go through the windows
    drivers. (sigh)&lt;p&gt;

    According to the &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://hpoj.sourceforge.net/suplist.shtml&quot;&gt;hpoj
    project&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;i&gt;...if you have a LaserJet 3150 connected to an HP
    JetDirect 70X/170X/300X/500X with firmware x.08.xx or later, you
    can scan using the JetDirect&apos;s embedded web
    server.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    So this is a multifunction device that only scans!&lt;p&gt;

    If you have the luxury of a seperate MS Windows box, you can share
    the printer in the following manner:&lt;p&gt;
 
    After installing the normal drivers and JetSuite (HP software),
    add yet another printer. Use the LPT1: port and HP LasertJet II as
    the driver, then share this printer. You can now access this share
    via Linux as an SMB client; use the vanilla &quot;laserjet&quot;
    driver. The PCL emulation will complain, though the printout is
    fine thus far. You can turn off the complaints by editing your
    $WINDIR\JETSUITE.INI and in the &quot;[PCLEmulation]&quot;
    section, set &quot;DisplayWarning=no&quot;.&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;a
    href=&quot;/download/printing/hplj_3100_3150/&quot;&gt;Reverse-engeneering
    efforts&lt;/a&gt; on the printer&apos;s protocol have already
    started, but were not finished. Anyone who makes this device
    finally working with free software please report on the the HP
    Forum here on linuxprinting.org.&lt;p&gt;
